["seed-germination-process.html", "1 Seed germination process", " 1 Seed germination process The physiology and seed technology have provided valuable tools for the production of high quality seed and treatments and storage conditions (Marcos-Filho 1998). In basic research, the seeds are studied exhaustively, and the approach of its biology is performed to fully exploit the dormancy and germination (Penfield and King 2009). An important tool to indicate the performance of a seed lot is the precise quantification of germination through accurate analysis of the cumulative germination data (Joosen et al. 2010). Time, speed, homogeneity and synchrony are aspects that can be measured, and inform the dynamics of the germination process. These characteristics are interesting not only for physiologists and seed technologists, but also to environmentalists, since it is possible to predict the degree of success of the species, based on the seed crop ability to redistribute germination over time, allowing the recruitment the part of the environment formed seedlings (Ranal and Santana 2006).

In general, it is presented as percentage, accompanied by some degree of dispersion, but it is possible to use proportions to one or more samples may be subjected to statistical tests (Carvalho and Santana 2005). \\[ g=\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_1}{N}\\right)100 \\] Where: ni: number of germinated seed in the ith time; N: total number of seed in each experimental unit. 2.2 Mean Germination Time (t) It was proposed by Haberlandt in 1875. It is calculated as the weighted average germination time. The number of germinated seeds at the intervals established for the collection of data is used as weight. It is expressed in terms of the same units of time used in the germination count (Czabator 1962). \\[ t=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_it_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i} \\] Where ti: Time of start of experiment tempo to observation (days or hours); ni:number of seed germinated the ith time (number corresponding to ith observation); k:the last day of germination. 2.3 Mean Germination Rate (v) The average speed of germination is defined as the reciprocal of the average time germination (Ranal and Santana 2006). \\[ v\\ =\\frac{1}{i} \\] Where t: mean germination time 2.4 Uncertainty Index (U) The uncertainty index (U) is an adaptation of Shannon index measures the degree of uncertainty in predicting the informational entropy or uncertainty associated with the distribution of the relative frequency of germination (Gouvêa Labouriau 1983; Labouriau and Valadares 1983). Low values of U indicate frequencies with short peaks, i.e. the more concentrated the germination in time. Just a germinated seed changes the value of U. This means that u measures the degree of germination scattering. \\[ -\\sum_{i=1}^kf_i\\log_2f_i\\ \\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\ \\ f_i=\\frac{n_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i} \\] Where fi: relative frequency of germination; ni:number of seed germinated in the time i number corresponding to ith observation); k:the last day of germination. 2.5 Synchrony Index (Z) The Synchrony Index (Z) has been proposed to assess the degree of overlap between flowering individuals in a population. Adopting the idea expressed by PRIMACK (1980), Synchrony index is the synchrony of germination of one seed with other included in the same replication. When synchrony index = 1, germination of all the seeds occurs at the same time and when synchrony index = 0, at least two seeds can germinate one each time. Synchrony index produces a number if and only if there are two seeds finishing the seed germination process at the same time. Thus, the value of Z assessments is the grade of overlap between seed germination. \\[Z=\\frac{\\sum_{ }^{ }C_{n_1,2}}{N}\\ \\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\ C_{n_1,2}=\\frac{n_i\\left(n_i-1\\right)}{2}\\ \\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\ N=\\frac{\\sum_{ }^{ }n_i\\left(\\sum_{ }^{ }n_i-1\\right)}{2}\\] Where Cn1,2: combination of germinated seeds in ith time; ni:number of germinated seed in the time i.

["germination-field-book.html", "3 Germination Field book 3.1 Data Organization 3.2 Data Collection", " 3 Germination Field book For correct analysis and fast data processing is important take account the data organization and the correct data collection of the germination process. This section we going to explain how you have to collect and organize your data. For data example and layout, you can access and download GerminaQuant spreadsheet. 3.1 Data Organization The field book should have 3 essential parts; the factor columns (red). It will be use for the experiment treatment and statistical analysis and It will be according your experimental design; the seed number column (green) It will indicate the number of seed sown in each experimental units and the evaluation days column (blue), It will be fill with the germination values and It will be last according the experiment programmation and requirements. Figure 3.1 You can design your own field book with different names in the column, remember you need at least one column with factors or treatments, the column with the number of seed for each experimental unit and the evaluation days (with prefix) according to the time lapse of your experiment. Figure 3.1: Layout for germination evaluation process. The factor column (red) are according the experimental design. The seed number column (green) for the number of seed sown and the evaluation columns (blue) are for accounting the germination. 3.2 Data Collection The evaluation of the germination process is obtained of the count of the germination in each experimental unit and It can be evaluated in time lapse of hours, days or months in continuous interval of the same length always beginning with the time zero (ei. Ti00) until the germination is complete and It can be when for 5 evaluation collection the values of germination are constant or according the experimental design. "],

You can use a data sample for use the software in the following link: GerminaQuant Data Sample. The document should be in “csv” format. In case for use the sample, open the link and download the data in csv format. Files &gt;&gt; Download &gt;&gt; Comma Separated Values (.csv, current sheet) &gt;&gt; “GerminaQuant - Sample.csv” If you have a google account you can clone the document for you and edit it online and download for your own analysis. 5.2 Import Data When you have your field book, you can go GerminaQuant and go “Data Import” tab. Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1: Data Import Choose the file in “csv” format will be analysed. There are two case that will have default values if you use the . “Column with seeds number” you have to write the name of the column containing the information of the number of seed sown in each experimental unit , “Prefix of evaluation days” you have to put the prefix of the name called for the day for evaluate the germination time lapse. Figure 5.2: Table option for csv format Below of the parameter for evaluation, you will find the option to select the parameter for the “csv” format file, in such way the file should have a table form. Figure 5.2 5.3 Germination analysis If the parameter in the “Import Data” tab are correct, in “Germination analysis” tab will be appear the values of the eleven germination variables for each experimental unit. Figure 5.3 Figure 5.3: Variables calculated with GerminaQuant GerminaQuant app allow to download the file in “csv” format with the calculation of the germination variables. Figure 5.4 Figure 5.4: Dowload option for the calculated variables 5.4 Statistical analysis In this tab, the app perform a unifactor variance analysis, calculate the statistical description of the factor, the mean differences through three mean test: Tukey, Student Newman Keuls and Duncan and made the graphic for the chosen variable. Figure 5.5: Statitical analysis with ANOVA and mean comparison test Remember, the independiente variables will be the factor in your field book and the dependent variable will be any of the eleven of germination variables. Automatically the app will generate the graph for the variable chosen and give the mean comparison test. The axis label can be edited manually filling the case in the “Graphics labels” section. The bar graphs represent the mean and central line the standard error. 5.5 Germination in Time This Tab allows to visualise the germination process for each factor included in the field book. Figure 5.6 Figure 5.6: Germination in time plot The app give two graphics, the first is the germination in percentage in time lapse and the second the relative germination that calculate the germination according the total number of seed germinated. 5.6 Box Plot This section allows to plot the distribution of the germination observation through the box plot (outliers values and overlapping values) and allows to put label in the graph (Figure 5.7). In the section “Graphics variables”, “Axis X” and “Grouped” you should choose between the factor in the the field book, are recommended in the “Axis X” you should choose the factor with more level and “Grouped” the factor with less levels, and the “Axis Y” any of the eleven germination variables, in the case you have only one factor “Axis X” and “Grouped” should have the same factor. The axis label can be edited manually filling the case in the “Graphics labels” section. Figure 5.7: Detection of outlier and overlapping values with box plot graphic "],
