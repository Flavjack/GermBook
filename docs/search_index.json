["seed-germination-process.html", "1 Seed germination process", " 1 Seed germination process The physiology and seed technology have provided valuable tools for the production of high quality seed and treatments and storage conditions (Marcos-Filho, 1998). In basic research, the seeds are studied exhaustively, and the approach of its biology is performed to fully exploit the dormancy and germination (Penfield &amp; King, 2009). An important tool for indicate the performance of a seed lot is the precise quantification of germination through accurate analysis of the cumulative germination data (Joosen et al., 2009). Time, velocity, homogeneity, uncertainty and synchrony are measurements that inform the dynamics of the germination process. It is interesting not only for physiologists and seed technologists, but also for environmentalists, since it is possible to predict the degree of success of the species, based on the seed crop ability to redistribute germination over time, allowing the recruitment of part of the seedlings formed (Ranal &amp; Santana, 2006).

You can use a following data as an example data. If you have a Google account you can clone the document and edit it online and download for your own analysis. 3.2 Field book When you have your field book, you can go GerminaQuant for R and go “Fieldbook” tab. Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Fieldbook interface for import your data You can paste a Google spread sheet URL or upload a local file in xlsx format. In “Seeds (col name)” you have to write the name of the column containing the information of the number of seed sown in each experimental unit, for “Evaluations (prefix)” you have to put the prefix of the names for the evaluated days from the germination time lapse. 3.3 Germination If the parameter in the “Fieldbook” tab are correct, in “Germination” tab will be performed and the values of the germination indices for each experimental unit will be shown. Table ??. GerminaQuant allows to copy or downloading the file in “csv” or “xlsx” format with the calculation of the germination variables. Figure 3.2 Figure 3.2: Dowload option for the calculated variables 3.4 Statistical The application can perform a factorial analysis according you experimental design (crd, crbd or lsd), and calculate the analysis of variance and the mean differences through Student Newman Keuls, Tukey or Duncan test according the chosen variable. Figure 3.3: Statitical analysis with ANOVA and mean comparison test 3.5 Graphics Automatically after performed the statistical analysis the application will generate the graphs for the variable chosen with the mean comparison test. The interface allows customized bar or line plot and export in “tiff” format for publication quality. Figure 3.4: Customized interface for bar or line plot 3.6 InTime This Tab allows to visualize the germination process according the experimental factors. The interface allows customized the graphic. Figure 3.5 Figure 3.5: Germination in time plot The application allows to plot two type of graphics, the first is the germination in percentage in time lapse and the second the relative germination that calculate the germination according the total number of germinated seeds.

In this section, we are going to explain how can you collect and organize your data. For data example and layout, you can access and download GerminaQuant spreadsheet. 4.1 Data Organization The field book should have three essential parts.(1) The factor columns (red), according to the experimental design;(2) the seed number column, indicate the number of seeds sown in each experimental unit (green) and (3) the evaluation columns with the germination values (blue) (Figure 4.1). You can design your own field book with different names in the column according your experimental design. Figure 4.1: Layout for germination evaluation process. The factor column (red) are according the experimental design. The seed number column (green) for the number of seed sown and the evaluation columns (blue) for accounting the germination. 4.2 Data Collection The evaluation of the germination process is obtained of the count of the germination in each experimental unit and It can be evaluated in time lapse of hours, days or months in continuous interval of the same length always beginning with the time zero (ei. Ti00), until the end of the germination process or according to the researcher criteria. "],
