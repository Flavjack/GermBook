GerminaQuant app is reactive!. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs. The principal features of the application allows to calculate the principal germination indices, statistical analysis and easy way to plot the results.

["seed-germination-process.html", "1 Seed germination process", " 1 Seed germination process The physiology and seed technology have provided valuable tools for the production of high quality seed and treatments and storage conditions (Marcos-Filho, 1998). In basic research, the seeds are studied exhaustively, and the approach of its biology is performed to fully exploit the dormancy and germination (Penfield &amp; King, 2009). An important tool for indicate the performance of a seed lot is the precise quantification of germination through accurate analysis of the cumulative germination data (Joosen et al., 2009). Time, velocity, homogeneity, uncertainty and synchrony are measurements that inform the dynamics of the germination process. It is interesting not only for physiologists and seed technologists, but also for environmentalists, since it is possible to predict the degree of success of the species, based on the seed crop ability to redistribute germination over time, allowing the recruitment of part of the seedlings formed (Ranal &amp; Santana, 2006).

In this section we will explain how you should collect and organize your data. 2.1 Prepare you field book For using GerminaR and GerminaQuant is necessary that you have a dataset with germination values. You can use a following data as an example “prosopis”. If you have a Google account you can made a copy of the document and edit it online or download in Excel format for your own analysis. 2.2 Data Organization The field book should have three essential parts.(1) The factor columns (red), according to the experimental design;(2) the seed number column, indicate the number of seeds sown in each experimental unit (green) and (3) the evaluation columns with the germination values (blue) (Figure 2.1). You can design your own field book with different names in the column according your experimental design. Figure 2.1: Layout for germination evaluation process. The factor column (red) are according the experimental design. The seed number column (green) for the number of seed sown and the evaluation columns (blue) for accounting the germination. 2.3 Data Collection The evaluation of the germination process is obtained of the count of the germination in each experimental unit and It can be evaluated in any time lapse (hours, days, months, etc) in continuous interval of the same length always beginning with the time zero (ei. Ti00), until the end of the germination process or according to the researcher criteria. "],

Figure 4.1. Figure 4.1: Fieldbook interface for import your data You can paste a Google spread sheet URL or upload a local file in xlsx format. In “Seeds (col name)” you have to write the name of the column containing the information of the number of seed sown in each experimental unit, for “Evaluations (prefix)” you have to put the prefix of the names for the evaluated days from the germination time lapse. 4.2 Germination If the parameter in the “Fieldbook” tab are correct, in “Germination” tab will be performed and the values of the germination indices will be shown maintaining the experimental design. GerminaQuant allows to copy or downloading the information in “csv” or “xlsx” format. Figure 4.2 Figure 4.2: Dowload option for the calculated variables 4.3 Statistical The GerminaQuant application can perform analysis for experimental design in a Complete Randomize Design (CRD), Randomize Complete Block Design (RCBD), Latin Square Design (LSD) or factorial designs, allowing calculate the analysis of variance (AOV) and the mean differences through Student Newman Keuls (SNK), Tukey or Duncan test.

The functions will de explain according to the data set included in the GerminaR package (“prosopis”). Install and load the GerminaR package. Load the “prosopis” dataset on your session. In case of using another dataset, you can load your own data and proceed according to the following script: # Install packages and dependencies library(GerminaR) library(tidyverse) # load data fb &lt;- prosopis %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(across(c(nacl, temp, rep), as.factor)) # Prosopis data set fb %&gt;% web_table(caption = &quot;Prosopis dataset loaded&quot;) Calculate the germination indices and perform the ANOVA and the mean comparison tests.

If you need manipulate the x labels you can work directly with ggplot2. I will implement in the next versions of GerminaR the possibility to manipulate the x axis with fplot() function. Also, you can see Bar and line graphs (ggplot2) git &lt;- ger_intime(Factor = &quot;temp&quot; , SeedN = &quot;seeds&quot; , evalName = &quot;D&quot; , method = &quot;percentage&quot; , data = fb ) ggplot &lt;- git %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = evaluation , y = mean , group = temp , shape = temp )) + geom_line() + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(name = &quot;Days&quot; , minor_breaks = 2 , limits = c(0, 11) ) + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Germination&quot;) + scale_shape_discrete(&quot;Temperature&quot;) + theme_bw() ggplot "],
