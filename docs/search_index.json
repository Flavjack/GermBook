["evaluation-of-the-seed-germination-process.html", "1 Evaluation of the seed germination process", " 1 Evaluation of the seed germination process The physiology and seed technology have provided valuable tools for the production of high quality seed and treatments and storage conditions (Marcos-Filho, 1998). In basic research, the seeds are studied exhaustively, and the approach of its biology is performed to fully exploit the dormancy and germination (Penfield &amp; King, 2009). An important tool for indicate the performance of a seed lot is the precise quantification of germination through accurate analysis of the cumulative germination data (Joosen et al., 2010). Time, velocity, homogeneity, uncertainty and synchrony are measurements that inform the dynamics of the germination process. It is interesting not only for physiologists and seed technologists, but also for environmentalists, since it is possible to predict the degree of success of the species, based on the seed crop ability to redistribute germination over time, allowing the recruitment of part of the seedlings formed (Ranal &amp; Santana, 2006).

G. Labouriau (1983a), germinability is the percentage of seeds in which the germination process comes to the end in the experimental conditions by the intraseminal growth, resulting in the protrusion (or emergence) of a living embryo. \\[G=\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i}{N}\\right)100\\] In percentage; expressed in the package as GRP. Where: \\(n_i\\): number of germinated seed in the \\(i^{th}\\) time; \\(N\\): total number of seed in each experimental unit. 2.2 Mean Germination Time (\\(\\overline{t}\\)) and Standard Deviation (\\(S_t\\)) The mean germination time was proposed by Haberlandt in 1875 (L. G. Labouriau, 1983a) and used by Czabator (1962) as mean length of incubation time (see Ranal &amp; Santana (2006) for other details). It is calculated as the weighted mean of the germination time (hour, day or other time unit). The number of germinated seeds at the intervals established for the data collection is used as weight (Ranal &amp; Santana, 2006). \\[\\overline{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_it_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i}\\] In hour, day or other time unit; expressed in the program as MGT. \\[S_t=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i\\left(t_i-\\overline{t}\\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i-1}}\\] In the same time unit of the mean germination time; expressed in the program as SDG. Where: \\(t_i\\): time from the start of the experiment to the \\(i^{th}\\) observation (hour, day or other time unit); \\(n_i\\): number of germinated seeds in the \\(i^{th}\\) time (not the accumulated number); \\(k\\): the last time of observation and \\(\\overline{t}\\): mean germination time. 2.3 The germination variance of the germination time (\\(S_t^2\\)). The germination variance is expressed by: \\[S_t^2=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i\\left(t_i-\\overline{t}\\right)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i-1}\\] In the square time unit of the meangermination time; expressed in the program as VGT. Where: \\(t_i\\): time from the start of the experiment to the \\(i^{th}\\) observation (square time unit); \\(n_i\\): number of germinated seeds in the \\(i^{th}\\) time (not the accumulated number); \\(k\\): the last time of observation and \\(\\overline{t}\\): mean germination time. 2.4 Coefficient of variation of the germination time (\\(CV_t\\)). \\[CV_t=\\left(\\frac{S_t}{\\overline{t}}\\right)100\\] In percentage; expressed in the program as CVG. Where: \\(S_t\\): standard deviation of the germination time and \\(\\overline{t}\\): mean germination time. 2.5 Mean Germination Rate (\\(\\overline{v}\\)) The mean germination rate is defined as the reciprocal of the mean germination time, since the mean germination rate increases and decreases with \\(\\frac{1}{\\overline{t}}\\), not with \\(\\overline{t}\\) (L. G. Labouriau, 1983b). \\[\\overline{v}=\\frac{1}{\\overline{t}}\\] Inverse of time unit; expressed in the program as MGR. Where: \\(S_t\\): \\(\\overline{t}\\): mean germination time. 2.6 Germination speed coefficient (\\(G_s\\)) The germination speed coefficient which can be calculated by the formula: \\[G_s=\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^kG_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^kG_iX_i}\\right)100\\] In percentage; expressed in the program as GSP. Where: \\(G_i\\), number of seeds germinated in the \\(i^{th}\\) time; \\(X_i\\), number of days from sowing. 2.7 Uncertainty index (\\(U\\)) This measurement is an adaptation of the Shannon index and measures the degree of uncertainty associated to the distribution of the relative frequency of germination (L. Labouriau &amp; Valadares, 1976). Low values indicate more synchronized germination (Ranal &amp; Santana, 2006). \\[U\\ =\\ -\\sum_{i=1}^kf_i\\log_2f_i\\ ,\\ being\\ f_i=\\frac{n_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^kn_i}\\] In bit; expressed in the package as UNC. Where: \\(f_i\\): relative frequency of germination; \\(n_i\\): number of seed germinated in the \\(i^{th}\\) time, and \\(k\\): the last day of germination. 2.8 Synchronyzation index (\\(Z\\)) This index was proposed by Primack (1985) to assess the degree of overlapping of flowering among individuals in a population and Ranal &amp; Santana (2006) adopted it for seed germination. The synchrony of germination of one seed with another assumed \\(Z=1\\) when the germination of all seeds occur at the same time and \\(Z = 0\\) when at least two seeds can germinate, one at each time. \\[Z=\\frac{\\sum_{ }^{ }C_{n_1,2}}{N};\\ being\\ C_{n_1,2}=\\frac{n_i\\left(n_i-1\\right)}{2}\\ ;\\ N=\\frac{\\Sigma n_i\\left(\\Sigma n_i-1\\right)}{2}\\] Adimensional measurement; expressed in the program as SYN. Where: \\(C_{n_i,2}\\): combination of germinated seeds in \\(i^{th}\\) time, two together, and \\(n_i\\): number of germinated seed in the \\(i^{th}\\). 2.9 Limits and units of the germination variables in GerminaQuant Table 2.1: Germination variables evaluated in GerminaQuant for R and limits according Ranal &amp; Santana (2006) ; where: \\(n_i\\), number of seed germinated in \\(i^{nth}\\) time ; \\(K\\), the last day of the avaliation process for germination.

In this section, we are going to explain how can you collect and organize your data. For data example and layout, you can access and download GerminaQuant spreadsheet. 3.1 Data Organization The field book should have three essential parts.(1) The factor columns (red), according to the experimental design;(2) the seed number column, indicate the number of seeds sown in each experimental unit (green) and (3) the evaluation columns with the germination values (blue) (Figure 3.1). You can design your own field book with different names in the column according your experimental design. Figure 3.1: Layout for germination evaluation process. The factor column (red) are according the experimental design. The seed number column (green) for the number of seed sown and the evaluation columns (blue) for accounting the germination. 3.2 Data Collection The evaluation of the germination process is obtained of the count of the germination in each experimental unit and It can be evaluated in time lapse of hours, days or months in continuous interval of the same length always beginning with the time zero (ei. Ti00), until the end of the germination process or according to the researcher criteria. "],
